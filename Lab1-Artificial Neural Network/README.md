# Artificial Neural Network for Face Recognition
- Lab homepage: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/faces.html
- Code:
  - You can compile the python script "recognition.py" in Linux and see the result.
    > python recognition.py
  - You can also train it yourself by modifying codes in "main.cpp" and make it.
    > make all
  - Note that the neural network is defined in "Network.cpp".
- Result Description:
  - Note: You may find a tester in each directory.
    > python linux_tester.py
 Â - First, you can select an image
    - Both "xxx_2.pgm" and "xxx_4.pgm" could be successfully opened, but "xxx.pgm" can't. It is probably because I use Python PIL Library and it may not provide a support for ".pgm" file in P5 format.)

  - Then, the result is displayed: (Note that you may need to re-make the whole project. There could be some problems here.)
