# Artificial Neural Network for Face Recognition
- Lab Description: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/faces.html
- Code
  - You can compile the python script "recognition_linux.py" and see the result.
    > python recognition_linux.py
  - You can also train it yourself by modifying codes in "main.cpp" and make it.
    > make all
  - Note that the neural network is defined in "Network.cpp"
- Result Description
  - Note: You may find a tester in each directory.
    > python linux_tester.py
